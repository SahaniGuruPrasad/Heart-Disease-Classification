# Heart-Disease-Classification
## Objective
In the Modern day life style the risk of heart disease is significantly increasing as compare to the earier days life style. Food Consumtion, Living Environment, Physical Activities, Stress and Workload management, Habits like Alcohol consumption or smoking etc are factors which are highly related to the risk of heart diseases. This project is intended to predict the risk of heart disease such as whether the patient is prone to heart disease or not with his daily life and living style activities as factors using Machine Learning.

## Goal🎯
The Goal of this project is to build and implement an Accurate Machine Learning Model which can predict whether the patient is prone to heart disease or not.

## Summary/Breakdown of Project 📜
<ul>
  <li><b>Data Collection</b>
    <p>Data Source: Kaggle Dataset (“ Heart Disease Health Indicators Dataset ”)</p>
    <p>Size 2,53,680 rows and 22 columns</p>
  </li>
  <li><b>Data Cleaning</b>
    <p>Handling of Missing Values, Encoding of Categories(present in float converted to integer) and Feature Scaling for better Model performance</p>
  </li>
  <li><b>Exploratory Data Analysis</b>
    <p>Presenting the Summary stats of entire dataset</p>
    <p>Representing the relationship between each and every features/columns with heatmap</p>
    <p>Outlier Dectection and further assessment</p>
    <p>Representing the Distribution of every feature</p>
    <p>Presenting the similarity and difference of patient with prone to heart disease and patient which are not prone to heart disease</p>
  </li>
  <li><b>Model Development</b>
    <p>Build multiple Machine Learning models such as Logistic Regression, Desicion Tree and K Nearest Neighbors</p>
    <p>Trained the model by spliting the data into 80% for training and 20% for testing</p>
    <p>Evaluated multiple models with multiple evaluation techniques such as Accuracy and Classification report(Precision, Recall, and F1-Score) to find the best accurate performing model from the above models(i.e Logistic Regression)</p>
  </li>
  <li><b>Model Validation</b>
    <p>Implemented Hyperparameter Tuning with GridSearch CV(Cross Validation with 5 folds) to improve the model efficiency with an improved accuracy of 90% and for better generalization predicting results</p>
  </li>
</ul>
